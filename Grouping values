There are N integers given in an array arr. You have to determine if it is possible to divide them in at most K groups, such that any group does not have a single integer more than twice.

Example 1:

Input: N = 5, K = 2
arr = {1, 1, 2, 5, 1}
Output: 1
Explaination: We can divide them in two groups in 
following way (1, 1, 2, 5) and (1)


Code: class Solution{
public:
    int isPossible(int N, int arr[], int K){
        unordered_map<int,int>mp;
        for(int i=0;i<N;i++)
        {
            mp[arr[i]]++;
        }
        for(auto x:mp)
        {
            if(x.second> (2*K))
            return 0;
        }
    return 1;}
};
